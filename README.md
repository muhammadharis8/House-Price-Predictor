# House-Price-Predictor
Python Project


This repository contains a project focused on predicting house prices using Machine Learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to build a robust predictive model that can estimate house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the raw dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed in-depth analysis to understand data patterns, correlations, and insights.
Feature Engineering: Created new features and optimized existing ones to improve model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented and compared various ML algorithms, such as:
Linear Regression
